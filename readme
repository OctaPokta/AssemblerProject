                Final Product of My Assembler
                        Version 1.0
                       August 8, 2024

            *** PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE RUNNING ***
                        SUPER IMPORTANT
-----------------------------------------------------------

Here are a few important details before running the program:

1. All input files should be placed under the main directory (i.e., "Maman14 - Gal Reuveni").
2. All the ".am" files are created under the /pre_processing/ directory.
3. The output files will be generated in the /output/ directory.

                            Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------

* I added a directory with multiple run examples, as requested. It is splitted into three categories:
- No errors (success)
- Errors
- Command-line argument errors

* Some of the examples also contain screenshots. For some of them, I linked screenshots of "valgrind" to show that there aren't any memory leaks or errors.

* /pre_processing/ takes care of the pre_assembler process, while /assembler/ takes care of the assembler process.

* Each .h or .c file contain description for every file, function or important data. it is recommended to read it before making any changes or debugging. 

* Optional: use "make clean" in order to clean all the object files.

* Optional: there are three optional functions that aren't part of the assembler and can be used for test-purposes only, in order to print data on screen. they are under /assembler/assembler.h, named as: "printPCmemory()", "printLabel()" and "printInstructionImage()".

            That's all, enjoy the program :)
